            I really love doing it, I even want to act in a ðŸ˜‡Netflix series or moviesðŸ˜‡. My favourit Actress is Mllie Bobby Brown who has acted in the famous series Stranger Things. I just love her and her acting skills. Eventually half of it was acting in Green Screen. I also oneday want to be on that big screen and walk on that red carpet and want fan edits.</p>
